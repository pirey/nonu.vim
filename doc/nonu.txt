SUMMARY                                         *nonu*

For some filetypes, line number doesn't make sense and they're just there
taking space without purpose.

This plugin let you easily hide line number for all specified filetypes.

EXAMPLE                                         *nonu-example*

>
    let g:nonu_filetypes = ['git', 'gitcommit', 'fzf', 'fugitive']
<

After that, when you open any of those filetypes, line number will be hidden
by default.
